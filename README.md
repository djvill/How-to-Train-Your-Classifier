This repository hosts a guide that walks readers through the process of training a **random-forest classifier for automated coding of sociophonetic variation**, using the statistical computing language `R` and the packages `ranger` and `caret`. This guide is intended to be a companion to our manuscript soon to be submitted to *Laboratory Phonology*, and it recreates the classifier of Southland English non-prevocalic /r/ discussed in the manuscript. The guide is presented in both [html](https://nzilbb.github.io/How-to-Train-Your-Classifier/How_to_Train_Your_Classifier.html) and [R Markdown](https://nzilbb.com/djvill/How-to-Train-Your-Classifier/blob/master/How_to_Train_Your_Classifier.Rmd) formats; by consulting the latter, readers can run the code on their own systems to recreate the /r/ classifier.
