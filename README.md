This repository hosts a guide that walks readers through the process of training a **random-forest classifier for automated coding of sociophonetic variation**, using the statistical computing language `R` and the packages `ranger` and `caret`. This guide is intended to be a companion to our manuscript under review at *Laboratory Phonology*, and it recreates the classifier of Southland English non-prevocalic /r/ discussed in the manuscript. The guide is presented in both [html](https://nzilbb.github.io/How-to-Train-Your-Classifier/How_to_Train_Your_Classifier.html) and [R Markdown](https://github.com/nzilbb/How-to-Train-Your-Classifier/blob/master/How_to_Train_Your_Classifier.Rmd) formats; by consulting the latter, readers can run the code on their own systems to recreate the /r/ classifier.

Anonymized data is available for both the [non-prevocalic /r/](https://github.com/nzilbb/How-to-Train-Your-Classifier/blob/master/Data/RClassifierData_03July2019.Rds) and [word-medial intervocalic /t/](https://github.com/nzilbb/How-to-Train-Your-Classifier/blob/master/Data/TClassifierData_14Nov2019.Rds) classifiers reported in the paper.
